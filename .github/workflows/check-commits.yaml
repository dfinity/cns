      # For external contributions, the suggested flow is as follows:
      #   1. Contributor creates a fork and enables GH Actions on it
      #   2. Contributor develops in a fork, and pushes the changes to a branch named with prefix `dev-gh-`.
      #      The push triggers the tests on the contributor's fork on a Github Runner
      #   3. Once the code in a branch is ready and passes the tests, the contributor creates a PR on the main repo.
